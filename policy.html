Smart Mobile Apps Studio Privacy Statement
What information Smart Mobile Apps Studio collects and why
Categories of personal information

"User Personal Information" is any personal information about one of our users which could, alone or together with other information, personally identify them. Information such as a user name and password, an email address, a real name, and a photograph are examples of “User Personal Information.” User Personal Information includes Personal Data as defined in the General Data Protection Regulation.

"Technical Information" may include information we collect from website browsers, such as web server logs, or other log information, such as User session or activity logs. Technical Information may be connected to User Personal Information such as a username or an email address, or to other potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.

User Personal Information does not include aggregated, non-personally identifying information. We may use aggregated, non-personally identifying information to operate, analyze, improve, and optimize our website and service.
Information from users with accounts

If you create an account, we require some basic information at the time of account creation. You will create your own user name and password, and we will ask you for a valid email address. You also have the option to give us more information if you want to, and this may include "User Personal Information."

If you sell a Smart Mobile Apps Studio Marketplace application or raise funds through the Smart Mobile Apps Studio Sponsors Program, we require some additional information through the registration process. We may require identification information and banking information for you to receive funds through those services.
Information from website browsers

If you're just browsing the website, we collect the same basic information that most websites collect. We use common internet technologies, such as cookies and web server logs, to collect Technical Information. This is stuff we collect from everybody, whether they have an account or not.

The information we collect about all visitors to our website includes the visitor’s browser type, language preference, referring site, additional websites requested, and the date and time of each visitor request. We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.
Information we collect from third parties

From time to time, Smart Mobile Apps Studio receives personal information about individuals from third parties. This may happen if you sign up for a training or to receive information about Smart Mobile Apps Studio from one of our vendors.
Why we collect this information

    We need your User Personal Information to create your account, and to provide the services you request, including to provide the Smart Mobile Apps Studio service, the Marketplace service, the Sponsors Program, or to respond to support requests.
    We use your User Personal Information, specifically your user name, to identify you on Smart Mobile Apps Studio.
    We use it to fill out your profile and share that profile with other users if you ask us to.
    We will use your email address to communicate with you, if you've said that's okay, and only for the reasons you’ve said that’s okay. Please see our section on email communication for more information.
    We use User Personal Information and other data to make recommendations for you, such as to suggest projects you may want to follow or contribute to. For example, when you fill out an interest survey at account creation, we learn from it — as well as from your public behavior on Smart Mobile Apps Studio, such as the projects you star — to determine your coding interests, and we recommend similar projects. These recommendations are automated decisions, but they have no legal impact on your rights.
    We collect Technical Information to better understand how our website visitors use Smart Mobile Apps Studio, and to monitor and protect the security of the website.
    We collect personal information from third parties for the purposes for which it was authorized to be collected. For example, you may authorize Smart Mobile Apps Studio to contact you for marketing purposes via a third party's platform. If we need to use your personal information for other purposes, we will ask your permission first.
    We use your User Personal Information and Technical Information for internal purposes, such as to maintain logs for security reasons, for training purposes, and for legal documentation and compliance.
    We limit our use of your User Personal Information to the purposes listed in this Privacy Statement. If we need to use your User Personal Information for other purposes, we will ask your permission first. You can always see what information we have, how we're using it, and what permissions you have given us in your user profile.

Our legal basis for processing information

Under certain international laws (including GDPR), Smart Mobile Apps Studio is required to notify you about the legal basis on which we process User Personal Information. Smart Mobile Apps Studio processes User Personal Information on the following legal bases:

    Contract Performance:
        When you create a Smart Mobile Apps Studio account, you provide your user name and an email address. We require those data elements for you to enter into the Terms of Service agreement with us, and we process those elements on the basis of performing that contract. We also process your user name and email address on other bases.
        If you have a Smart Mobile Apps Studio Hosted, Smart Mobile Apps Studio Enterprise Server, or other paid account with us, there will be other data elements we must collect and process on the basis of performing that contract. Smart Mobile Apps Studio does not collect or process a credit card number, but our third-party payment processor does.
        When you sell a Marketplace application or receive funds through the Sponsors Program, you provide identification and banking information. We process those elements on the basis of performing the contract that applies to those services.

    Consent:
        As a user, you can fill out the information in your user profile, and you have the option to provide User Personal Information such as your full name, an avatar which may include a photograph, your biography, your location, your company, and a URL to a third party website. You also have the option of setting a publicly visible email address here. If you decide to participate in a Smart Mobile Apps Studio research project or survey, you may choose to provide User Personal Information or other personal information to us for limited purposes. We process this information on the basis of consent. All of this information is entirely optional, and you have the ability to access, modify, and delete it at any time (while you are not able to delete your email address entirely, you can make it private).

    Legitimate Interests:
        Generally, the remainder of the processing of personal information we perform is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests. For example, for legal compliance purposes or to maintain ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of Smart Mobile Apps Studio's systems, website, and service, we must keep logs of Technical Information; and, in order to respond to legal process, we are required to keep records of users who have sent and received DMCA takedown notices.
    If you would like to request erasure of data we process on the basis of consent or object to our processing of personal information, please use our Privacy contact form.
